These are cypress api tests for LUSH QA task

All you need to do if you haven't already done is to install cypress:

npm install cypress --save-dev

Open the cypress runner using:

npx cypress open

The test are under a folder called lushtests. You can run all of them.

I've done one pass and one fail for each endpoint.
